# Motivation

A comprehensive file format explanation of each binary block of the game is required in order to make significant progress on the unpacking, repacking and reversing of this part of the game.

I'm using ImHex in order to create file format parsing so that I can better understand how it all work, and perhaps help the comprehension of others.
