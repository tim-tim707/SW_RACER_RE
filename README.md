# Star Wars Episode 1 Racer Decompilation Project

The goal of this repository is to document and re-implement functions of the original game for modding purposes.
The project is heavily influenced by the [OpenJKDF2](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/OpenJKDF2) project

This makes use of DLL injection through a simple loader located at `./loader/loader.cpp`
The code for the DLL to inject is at `./src`

For development the `dinput.dll` at `./dinput_hook` is used (see section Development for more information).

## Progress
The progress here lists the functions which have been analysed (not necessarily re-implemented)
- 25 October 2023, 30.54% (656 / 2148).
- 30 March 2024, 51.3% (1106 / 2156)

## Programs used
- git
- Ghidra 10.2.2 (important for the ret-sync plugin)
- x32dbg

## File formats
blocks are still TODO

## Contribute
This repository is still in early developement. Usage is not yet possible other than for decompilation purposes.

If you want to contribute, you'll need python, a windows C compiler and Ghidra.
Symbols can be imported using scripts in the `scripts/Ghidra` directory. You should "Parse C source" on the `src/types.h` file
before using the scripts to import functions prototypes via headers. Global variables can be imported from the
data\_symbols.syms file using the `GenerateGlobalHeaderFromSymbols.py` script in the `scripts/` directory. This will automatically
be generated at compile time when using the cmake build.

Update all submodules (for developpement purposes only):
`git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Development

Use 32-Bit MinGW and CMake to build the `dinput.dll` hook ([WinLibs GCC 13.2.0 (POSIX threads) + MinGW-w64 11.0.1 UCRT (release 5) i686](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/tag/13.2.0posix-17.0.6-11.0.1-ucrt-r5) is known to work). If `-DGAME_DIR=<game directory>` is passed as a CMake parameter the compiled `dinput.dll` is automatically placed into the game directory.
### dinput.dll configuration
- USE_RELEASE_HOOK
- WINDOWED_MODE_FIXES (Use different window flags on window creation and resize)
- GLFW_BACKEND (Use GLFW + OpenGL instead of Direct3D and Windows)
- GAME_DIR="pathToGame" (Move the compiled `dinput.dll` directly into the game directory)
- PYTHON_EXECUTABLE="pathToPython" (Cmake Specific)

The hook writes debug information into `hook.log` while running and makes all original game functions callable, as long as they have a valid address and function prototype in `./src`.

To test the decompilation of single functions they can be marked with a `// 0xADDRESS HOOK` comment to replace the original function in the game:

```cpp
// 0x004238d0 HOOK
int __stdcall WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PSTR pCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{
    ... this function will be called instead of the original WinMain function.
}
```

Remove the word `HOOK` if you don't want to replace the original function:

```
// 0x004238d0
int __stdcall WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PSTR pCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{
    ... this function will NOT be called.
}
```

## Usage

Run `compile.bat` script. The loader and the replacement dll should be generated in the `./build` directory. Copy these two files WITHOUT renaming them into the same directory as `SWEP1RCR.EXE`. Run the loader.

TODO Install python, gcc, g++ with MSYS2, git bash


This is based on the repository located [here](https://github.com/OpenSWE1R/swe1r-re.git), included as a submodule

The freshly installed GOG version of the game (`SWEP1RCR.EXE`) has the following md5: e1fcf50c8de2dbef70e6ad8e09371322
Other versions are not yet tested

[Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) will be used to run Visual C++ 5.0, the original compiler for the project. Through WSL, file transfer is much easier in both directions and Wine is much faster than a VM like Qemu or VirtualBox (and much simpler to setup as well)
